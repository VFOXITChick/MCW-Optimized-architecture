## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up an environment to use for the rest of
the exercises.

#### Task 1: Create a virtual machine for your lab environment 

1.  Launch a browser using incognite or in-private mode, and navigate to
    <https://portal.azure.com>. Once prompted, login with your Microsoft
    Azure credentials. If prompted, choose whether your account is an
    organization account or just a Microsoft Account.

2.  Click **+ Create a resource**, and in the search box, type in Visual Studio
    Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64), and press enter. Click
    the Visual Studio Community 2017 image running on Windows Server
    2016 and with the latest update.

3.  In the returned search results, click the image name.

    ![In the Everything blade, Visual Studio Community 2017 is typed in
    the Search field. Under Name, Visual Studio Community on Windows
    Server 2016 is
    circled.](images/Setup/image3.png "Everything blade")

    -   Subscription: **If you have multiple subscriptions choose the
        subscription to execute your labs in.**

    -   Resource Group: **OPSLABRG**

6.  Choose the **DS1\_V2 Standard** instance size on the Size blade.

7.  Accept the remaining default values on the Settings blade, and click
    **OK**. On the Summary page, click **OK**. The deployment should
    begin provisioning. It may take more than 10 minutes for the virtual
